## Instructions
The assignments must be completed using some features available in [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). In particular, we will make heavy use of `R markdown`. 

If you need help installing `R` and/or `Rstudio` on your computer, visit [this page](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) which contains a great how-to guide. 

Download the `Rmd` file relative to the assignment and open it in [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You will see the text of the assignment. 

Below each question, there is a "box," like this one
```
::: {#Q1 .answerbox}
<!-- Put your answer here -->
:::
```

Please, type your answer to each question (both code and text) between the `:::` marks. 

_Note:_ If you are using the live markdown feature of Rstudio, then you won't see the marks, but rather just  `<!-- Put your answer here -->` on a shadowed area. Type your answer in this area.

_Note:_ For a better experience, download this file [hw.css](https://www.dropbox.com/s/941gt5q7r8spdi0/hw.css?dl=1) and copy/move it to the same directory of the `Rmd` file containing the HW assignement. Then, in the preview (obtained when you hit the preview button), you will be able to visually distinguish your answer from the question text.
