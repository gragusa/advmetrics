## Instructions
The assignments must be completed using some features available in  [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). In particular, we will make heavy use of `R markdown`. 



If you need help installing `R` and/or `Rstudio` on your computer, visit [this page](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) which contains a great how-to guide. 

Download the `Rmd` file relative to the assignment and open it in [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/).  You will see the text of the assignment. 

Below each question, there is a "box," like this one
```
::: {#Q1 .answerbox}
<!-- Put your answer here -->
:::
```

Please, type your answer to each question (both code and text) between the `:::` marks. 

_Note:_ If you are using the live markdown feature of Rstudio, then you won't see the marks, but rather just  `<!-- Put your answer here -->` on a shadowed area. Type your answer in this area.

_Note:_ For a better experience, you can download [hw.css](https://www.dropbox.com/s/941gt5q7r8spdi0/hw.css?dl=1) and place it in the same directory of the `Rmd` file. Then, in the preview (obtained when you hit the preview button), you will be able to distinguish your answer from the question text.

Alternatively, you can use [NextJournal](https://nextjournal.com). 


Once you finish editing your homework, please follow the instructions on the [Homework Assignments Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a3a938b4e40ce466a9cf5bbdcffa124f4%40thread.tacv2/Homework%2520Assignments?groupId=3734028b-c82f-4a44-90d0-e5d52f8df440&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1) about the submission.
