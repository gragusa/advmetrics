## Instructions
The assignments must be completed either using [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) or using [NextJournal](https://nextjournal.com). 

### If you want to use [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/)

If you need help installing `R` and/or `Rstudio` on your computer, visit [this page](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) which contains a great how-to guide. 

Download the `Rmd` file relative to the assignment and open it in [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You will see the text of the assignment. 

Below each question, there is a "box," like this one
```
::: {#Q1 .answerbox}
<!-- Put your answer here -->
:::
```

Please, type your answer to each question (both code and text) between the `:::` marks. 

_Note:_ If you are using the live markdown feature of Rstudio, then you won't see the marks, but rather just  `<!-- Put your answer here -->` on a shadowed area. Type your answer in this area.

_Note:_ For a better experience, download this file [hw.css](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ah1yu597pn0fyi/hw.css?dl=1) and copy/move it to the same directory of the `Rmd` file containing the HW assignment. Then, in the preview (obtained when you hit the preview button), you will be able to distinguish your answer from the question text visually. 

Submit the Rmd file using the link provided. 

#### NextJournal

Follow the link for the [NextJournal](https://nextjournal.com) link of the homework. Remix the homework in your account. 

Do your work on your own. When you finish, export the notebook to Jupyter (you should get a file `.ipynb`) and submit it using the link.
