# Advanced Econometrics

Welcome to **246PP**, Advanced Econometrics, **Spring 2021** edition!

This is an _advanced_ econometrics course. 

The course's objective is to cover the theory behind classical econometrics and its applications in modern empirical analyses. The emphasis is mainly on the estimation of causal relations between economic variables. 

About a third of the lectures will be devoted to empirical applications. They wiil require [R](https://cran.r-project.org),  one of the most popular statistical languages used by both practitioners and researchers around the world. 


**Topics include:**

 - Basic Asymptotic Theory
 - Single Equation Linear Model and Ordinary Least Squares Estimation
 - Instrumental Variables Estimation of Single Equation Models
 - Basic Linear Unobserved Panel Data Models
 - Binary Response Models
 - General Estimation Framework for Nonlinear Models (GMM, MLE)
 - Special topic: Program Evaluation (if time allows)

### On-line communication

A dedicated [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3b04a0e7a517448aa84b1525fe986553%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=3734028b-c82f-4a44-90d0-e5d52f8df440&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1) will serve as communication hub. 


### Lectures 

- **Thursday** (9:00-10:30) and **Friday** (8:45-10:15) lectures are remote --- they will be live-streamed. For specific lectures, pre-recorded lectures will be made available few days earlier and the lecture time will be used for discussions.

- **Wednesday** (12:15-1:45) lectures follow a blended model (in presence with an a-online stream available). Information about the live streams will be made available on the Teams channel. 

The physical locations for the _Wednesday_ lectures are below:

\tableinput{}{lectures.csv}

Links and instructions for the live streams will be made available on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3b04a0e7a517448aa84b1525fe986553%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=3734028b-c82f-4a44-90d0-e5d52f8df440&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1)).


\note{
There is a **Tuesday slot (14:00, B01 Piagge)** reserved for blended lectures and lab sessions. We will move the Friday or the Thursday lecture to this slot from time to time. 

We will communicate in advance when the Tuesday lecture slot is used.

# Evaluation

The final grade will depend on several **homework assignments**, a **midterm exam**, a **comprehensive final exam**.
 
The comprehensive final is given on each _appello_, while the assignemnts and the midterms are given when the couirse is in session. The midterm and the assignments are optional, while scoring more than 18/30 on the comprehensive final is a mandatory requirement to pass the course. 

There are two evaluation options:

**(Standard option)**

**On the date of the appello right after the end of lectures,** the course grade is the maximum between 

1. the score on the final exam, and 
2. the average of the score on the final exam and the score on the homework assignments. 

The homework assignments will count toward the average if the student received at least 18/30 on each of them.

**On subsequent appelli**, the course grade is simply the grade on the comprehensive final exam.

---

**(Midterm option)**

1. a midterm exam (on **April, 9th**), and 
2. a comprehensive final exam (on the first appello) 

**On the date of the appello right after the end of lectures,** the course grade is the maximum between

1. the weighted average of the miterm's grade (30%), final's grade (40%) and the grades on the homework assignments (30%)

2. the weighted average of the miterm's grade (30%) and the comprehensive final's grade (70%) 

3. the comprehensive final's grade


\note{
- Only students with a grade of at least 18/30 on all homework assignments handed out before April 9th are allowed to take the midterm exam
- The grade on each assignment, the midterm, and the final must be at least 18/30 to be considered in the averages
- **This option is only available on the first appello.  On subsequent appelli**, the course grade is simply the grade on the comprehensive final exam
}

\warn{
Students will not be allowed to take the exam on two consecutive dates.
