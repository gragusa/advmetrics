# Advanced Econometrics

Welcome to **246PP**, Advanced Econometrics, **Spring 2022** edition!

This is an _advanced_ econometrics course. 

The course's objective is to cover the theory behind classical econometrics and its applications in modern empirical analyses. The emphasis is mainly on the estimation of causal relations between economic variables. 

About a third of the lectures will be devoted to empirical applications. They wiil require suing [R](https://cran.r-project.org), one of the most popular statistical languages used by practitioners as well as researchers around the world. 


**Topics include:**

 - Basic Asymptotic Theory
 - Single Equation Linear Model and Ordinary Least Squares Estimation
 - Binary Response Models
 - Instrumental Variables Estimation of Single Equation Models
 - Linear Unobserved Panel Data Models
 - General Estimation Framework for Nonlinear Models (GMM, MLE)
 - Special topic: Program Evaluation (if time allows)

# Textbooks

The textbook that we will use is:

_Wooldridge, Jeffrey M. Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data. MIT press, 2010._

\note{
There is a **Tuesday slot (14:00, B01 Piagge)** reserved for blended lectures and lab sessions. We will move the Friday or the Thursday lecture to this slot from time to time. 

We will communicate in advance when the Tuesday lecture slot is used.

# Assessment

The final grade will depend on several **homework assignments**, a **midterm exam**, a **comprehensive final exam**.
 
The comprehensive final is given on each _appello_, while the assignemnts and the midterms are given when the course is in session. The midterm and the assignments are optional, while scoring more than 18/30 on the comprehensive final is a mandatory requirement to pass the course. 

There are two evaluation options:

**(Standard option)**

**On the date of the appello right after the end of lectures,** the course grade is the maximum between 

1. the score on the final exam, and 
2. the average of the score on the final exam and the score on the homework assignments. 

The homework assignments will count toward the average if the student obtains a score of at least 18/30 on each of them.

**On subsequent appelli**, the course grade is simply the grade on the comprehensive final exam.

---

**(Midterm option)**

1. a midterm exam (on **TBA**), and 
2. a comprehensive final exam (on the first appello)

**On the date of the appello right after the end of lectures,** the course grade is the maximum between

1. the weighted average of the miterm's grade (30%), final's grade (30%) and the grades on the homework assignments (40%)

2. the weighted average of the miterm's grade (30%) and the comprehensive final's grade (70%) 

3. the weighted average of the homework assignemnts grades (30%) and the comprehensive final's grade (70%) 

5. the comprehensive final's grade


\note{
- Only students with a grade of at least 18/30 on all homework assignments handed out before **TBA** will be allowed to take the midterm exam
- The grade on each assignment, the midterm, and the final must be at least 18/30 to be considered in the average
- **This option is only available on the first appello. On subsequent appelli**, the course grade is simply the grade on the comprehensive final exam
}

\warn{
Students will not be allowed to take the exam on two consecutive dates.
