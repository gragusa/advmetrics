This homework assignment is due back on Thursday, March 25 (before
23:59) using the procedure described in the [Homework Assignments Teams
Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a3a938b4e40ce466a9cf5bbdcffa124f4%40thread.tacv2/Homework%2520Assignments?groupId=3734028b-c82f-4a44-90d0-e5d52f8df440&tenantId=c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1).

1.  Use `R` to generate $n=200$ observations from the following model
    $$y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}+u_{i},\quad n=1,\ldots,200$$ where
    $x_{i}$ and $u_{i}$ are independent and $(u_{i},x_{i})$ is
    [independent]{.ul} of $(u_{j},x_{j})$ for $i\neq j$;
    $$u_{i}\sim\chi_{3}^{2},\quad x_{i}\sim N(0,1),$$ and
    $\beta_{0}=0.5$ and $\beta_{1}=0.3$. ($\chi_{p}^{2}$ is the chi
    squared distribution with $p$ degrees of freedoms).

2.  Using the data generated in the previous model to estimate the
    $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ using OLS.

3.  Calculate the variance of the asymptotic distribution of
    $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ that is appropriate for the assumption of the
    model. (*(Note: You can use the output from `lm`, `summary` and
    other methods in packages, e.g. `sandwich`, but you will get extra
    credit if you try to calculate the variance without relying on
    them.))*

<!-- Please, keep the alignment of `:::` -->

4.  Construct a $90\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_{1}$.

5.  Since you generated the data yourself, you know which assumptions
    hold for the model above. Answer the question below providing a
    brief, but meaningful, justification:

    1.  Is OLS unbiased for $\beta_{0}$?

    :::

    2.  Is OLS unbiased for $\beta_{1}$?

    :::

    3.  Is the model conditionally homoscedastic?

    ::: {#Q5-3 .answerbox}
    <!-- Put your answer here -->
    :::

    4.  Is $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ estimating the partial effect?

    ::: {#Q5-4 .answerbox}
    <!-- Put your answer here -->
    :::

    5.  Can you derive the small sample distribution of
        $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ or you need more assumptions?

    ::: {#Q5-5 .answerbox}
    <!-- Put your answer here -->

6.  Suppose that instead of running a regression of $y_{i}$ on $x_{i}$,
    you run the regression of $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$, that is you switch
    the dependent and independent variables
    $$x_{i}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}y_{i}+\eta_{i}.$$ Report your estimates
    of $\gamma_{1}$.

::: {#Q6 .answerbox}
<!-- Put your answer here -->
:::

7.  What is $\gamma_{1}$ estimating, i.e. can you give the probability
    limit of $\hat{\gamma}_{1}$?

::: {#Q7 .answerbox}
<!-- Put your answer here -->
:::

8.  Find the asymptotic distribution of the estimator defined as
    $\hat{\xi}=1/\hat{\beta}_{1}$ where $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ is the OLS
    estimator of point (2). (*Hint: use the Delta Method.*)

9.  How the answers to [Question 5]{.ul} would change if you simulated
    the data from
    $$y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}+u_{i},\quad n=1,\ldots,200$$ where
    now $x_i$ and $u_i$ are generate according to
    $$x_{i}\sim N(0,1),\quad u_{i}=\sqrt{x_{i}^{2}}\times\varepsilon_{i},\quad\varepsilon_{i}\sim\chi_{3}^{2},$$
    and the parameters are $\beta_{0}=0.5$ and $\beta_{1}=0.3$? Give the
    OLS estimates and the appropriate standard errors.
